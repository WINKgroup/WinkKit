/// A useful class that is binded to `WKViewController`, `WKTableViewController` and `WKCollectionViewController`
/// that help you to navigate between view controllers by providing a lot of navigation methods.
/// It is a singleton class that has the current showing view controller.
/// Navigator object uses the `currentViewController` to push/present other view controllers. The current view controller
/// is set in `viewDidAppear(animated:)` of every WinkKit view controller, for this reason use this object only if you
/// use WinkKit view controllers.
///
/// - Warning: This class should be used only with WinkKit view controllers to avoid messing up everything.
///            If you decide to use Navigator class, you should always use WinkKit view controllers.
