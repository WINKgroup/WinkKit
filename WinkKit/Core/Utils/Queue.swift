/// A queue is a list where you can only insert new items at the back and remove items from the front.
/// This ensures that the first item you enqueue is also the first item you dequeue. First come, first serve!
/// In many algorithms you want to add objects to a temporary list and pull them off this list later. Often the order in which you add and remove these objects matters.
/// A queue gives you a FIFO or first-in, first-out order. The element you inserted first is the first one to come out.

    ///
    /// When you need to check whether your collection is empty, use the
    /// `isEmpty` property instead of checking that the `count` property is
    /// equal to zero. For collections that don't conform to
    /// `RandomAccessCollection`, accessing the `count` property iterates
    /// through the elements of the collection.
